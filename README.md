# Array_Bankist
This is a bankist app which mainly has three users namely 'Jonas Schmedtmann', 'Jessica Davis', 'Steven Thomas Williams'.

This app is made using HTML,CSS and JavaScript. It is only for education and practice purpose

## How this app works

### Step1
First you will see a login page. Here, there will be two fields first, user and pin.

### Step 2
As there are only two users, I have created short usernames for them :
1. Jonas Schmedtmann - 'js'
2. Jessica Davis - 'jd'
3. Steven Thomas Williams - 'stw'
We can use these shortforms in the 'user' field.

### Step 3
Same as 'user' field every user has different password as follows:
1. Jonas Schmedtmann - '1111'
2. Jessica Davis - '2222'
3. Steven Thomas Williams - '3333'

### Step 4
After logging in into any user you will find that, You can perform following actions:
1. Transfer Money to other user.
2. Take a loan.
3. Close your account

### Step 5
Finally, you will alse observe your withdrawals and deposite in the dashboard and you can also sort that
details using 'sort" button.
