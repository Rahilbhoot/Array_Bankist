# Array_Bankist
It is an Bank User managing website which basically uses fundamentals of array in JavaScript. I have just used Array and Array methods in this project. Please check it out.


It have 4 Accounts namely:
Account1 : Jonas Schmedtmann
Account2 : Jessica David
Account3 : Steven Thomas Williams
Account4 : Sarah Smith

Important Note* : To login to the final result it wants user first and last name first letter and password of all accounts are as follows : 

Account1 : username : 'js', password : 1111
Account2 : username : 'jd', password : 2222
Account3 : username : 'stw', password : 3333
Account4 : username : 'ss', password : 4444

Functionality : 
1 : It can basically first of all transfer money from one account to next
2 : Account user is capable to taking loan of maximum value : 10% of max deposite eg(if you have maximum deposite of 3000 you can only take loan of 30000)
3 : Account user can also close their account by simply giving username and password.
4 : You can Sort all deposits and withrawal movements by clicking sort button and vice versa


NOTE: it also contains a lot of comments in JavaScript file which is basically practice of all the array methods used in it.

Enjoy using it Thank you ðŸ˜€.
